toolchain to have a self-documenting example.  A more complete example

<div class="paragraph">
<p>TL;DR: The Fedora Docs Fad selected a toolchain of AsciiDoc+Pagure+Pintail
but it hasn&#8217;t been implemented. I think we can get to our goals
faster if we replace pintail <sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_2" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_2" title="View footnote.">2</a>]</sup> with
AsciiBinder. A full proof of concept and plan of work has been developed.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="where-are-we-today"><a class="anchor" href="#where-are-we-today"></a>Where are we today?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In May 2016 there was a Fedora Activity Day (FAD) focused on Fedora Docs.
I wasn&#8217;t present, but having seen the outbound reporting and blog posts,
I believe a reasoned and rational decision was made about a new tool
chain to adopt.  Based on the information available at the time and the
expected ability of those present to contribute an AsciiDoc+Pagure+Pintail
with legacy DocBook support toolchain was selected.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since the FAD, however, work has progressed slowly.  Unfortunately, I
don&#8217;t believe all the parties involved have been able to find the time
to make the contributions they envisioned.  It happens.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Just before Flock this year, I began adding my efforts to making the
proposed toolchain a reality.  The selected components are all great
pieces of technology, but some of them still need non-trivial work.
This work is ongoing and not complete.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I am not aware of any project plan with a timeline for completion and
current status reporting.  My assessment is that we are unlikely to be
finished by Fedora 26.  This means that we will continue to be relying
on DocBook and could not be fully converted to AsciiDoc until at least
the release after completion of the tooling.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="why-is-this-so-hard"><a class="anchor" href="#why-is-this-so-hard"></a>Why is this so hard?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Documentation toolchains are challenging for a lot of reasons.  One of
the biggest challenges is that, like many technology problems, this
problem looks far more simple to solve than it really is.  If you&#8217;re
still reading, and think I am just "not getting it," consider how the
mental solution you just mapped out would solve:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Multiple language (some of which are not translated against the most
recent revision)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multiple versions of software available in parallel</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multiple books or documentation collections with varying levels of
availability by version and language</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Producing the entire matrix of available materials and publishing it
to a single site or collection of related sites, logically</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drive by contributors who want zero friction</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regular contributors who want advanced tool sets</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The need to produce both stage and production versions of everything</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The need to generate a site with modern design and look and feel</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Search</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Making new material available for localization</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Automating all the things</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And this list doesn&#8217;t even get into the markup format war that can make
<code>emacs</code> vs <code>vi</code> look like a tea party.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another challenge with documentation toolchains is the fact that many of
the people closest to the problem are not engineers.  This means that
there are generally very few implementing contributors and that the
planning contributors are constantly trying to make sure their goals
are understood.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="my-proposal"><a class="anchor" href="#my-proposal"></a>My Proposal</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Therefore, I present this modest proposal <sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_3" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_3" title="View footnote.">3</a>]</sup> in order to accomplish the goals below:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>A rapid conversion to AsciiDoc and away from DocBook.  This should
significantly reduce contributor friction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ability to launch with at least the same level of functionality
as we have today before Fedora 26.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bringing the toolchain conversation to a close so we can focus on
what matters, <strong>content</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Specifically, a toolchain needs to be able to do the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Transform markup into HTML</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assemble a multi-version site</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assemble a multi-language site</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support being packaged in Fedora</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be able to be automated</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide a relatively easy set up experience for writers to test with</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interface with localization</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support Theming</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Integrate with a search solution</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My proposal can be summarized as AsciiDoc+Pagure+AsciiBinder.  It looks
very similar to the outcome of the FAD.  The parts are:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>AsciiDoc</strong>: A lightweight markup language that can be
<a href="http://www.winglemeyer.org/technology/2016/09/08/semantic-asciidoc/">extended with
a limited vocabulary of semantic markup</a> , as needed. It is widely
used and <a href="http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/index.html">extensively
documented</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pagure</strong>: An open-source git forge developed on Fedora and used by the
Fedora Community. You can find it at <a href="https://pagure.io">pagure.io</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>AsciiBinder</strong>: A documentation site builder that can build
multiple sites and versions from a single shared
documentation set.  <a href="http://www.asciibinder.org/">AsciiBinder</a> uses
<a href="http://asciidoctor.org/">Asciidoctor</a> to process AsciiDoc.  It is used
by the OpenShift and ManageIQ communities and is being considered by
Gluster for their AsciiDoc implementation.  It is heavily contributed
to by Red Hat.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="why-asciibinder"><a class="anchor" href="#why-asciibinder"></a>Why AsciiBinder?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I have selected AsciiBinder because it:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>is solely an AsciiDoc processor. This will force us to the new format
without delay.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it has been adopted by several
<a href="https://github.com/openshift/openshift-docs">open source</a>
<a href="https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq_docs">project</a>
communities. Therefore, it is going to both have longevity and a lot of
people looking for bugs and suggesting and implementing new features.
Additionally, if it is ever deprecated multiple communities will be
impacted so a new solution and migration path should be easily found.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it has a
<a href="https://github.com/redhataccess/ascii_binder/graphs/contributors">healthy
number of contributors</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it is a pure AsciiDoc toolchain with no conversions or other processing
<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_4" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_4" title="View footnote.">4</a>]</sup></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="how-does-it-work"><a class="anchor" href="#how-does-it-work"></a>How does it work?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My current implementation is architected around the following constraints:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Every book/document collection is stored in a separate repository,
as is done today.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Versions are controlled with branching.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Translations are done via Zanata</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All documentation is written using AsciiDoc</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each individual book/documentation collection repository is a valid
AsciiBinder repository.  This allows the tool to be directly used for
preview, staging, etc.  This also means that less transformation work
is required to build the entire website.  These individual repository
builds can be effected by directly running AsciiBinder so there is no
need for any scripting or other indirection.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The entire website is built using a builder script that builds an
AsciiBinder repository consisting of all titles, versions and translations
that are to be published.  The current builder applies translation files
during this repository creation process.  AsciiBinder is then called
to process this temporary repository and build the entire documentation
website.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This process is focused on reducing the amount of pre-processing,
massaging, modifications, and special cases to zero with the goal of
getting as close to a pure AsciiBinder implementation as possible.
Therefore the builder, for example, does not modify content in
any way other than is required for site building or applying
translations. Specifically, it does note change the file structure.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A sample of the proposed output
<a href="http://www.winglemeyer.org/fedora_docs_proposal/sample/">is available</a>.</p>
</div>

</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="risks"><a class="anchor" href="#risks"></a>Risks</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It isn&#8217;t all rainbows and unicorns though, there are a few challenges:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>`po4a&#8217;s AsciiDoc support is not perfect and needs some code updates to
handle all components of the current AsciiDoc standard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AsciiBinder has some opinions that differ from how Fedora works.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So far, the upstream of AsciiBinder has been open to conversation,
but they are unashamedly opinionated.  AsciiBinder came out of OpenShift
to solve their documentation tooling problems, specifically the need
to produce three different websites for three related, but slightly
different versions of OpenShift from a single shared content repository.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Specific Challenges Are:</p>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Single Repository Mindset in AsciiBinder</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>AsciiBinder is written from a multi-site multi-version
but single repository mindset. There is an open
<a href="https://github.com/redhataccess/ascii_binder/issues/54">issue</a> discussing
what to do with multi-repository documentation sets.  In the interim,
I have developed a script for building out an AsciiBinder formatted
repository from multiple repositories.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Language Translation Support in AsciiBinder</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>AsciiBinder has not considered the language translation question at
all, as far as I can tell. In the interim, the script mentioned above
implements a solution.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>AsciiDoc only support</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because AsciiBinder only supports AsciiDoc, we need to quickly convert
DocBook content.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
</div>

</ul>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="asciidoc"><a class="anchor" href="#asciidoc"></a>AsciiDoc</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While AsciiDoc enjoys a high level of adoption future mark up changes
could occur.  A method of protecting ourselves without violating
YAGNI <sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_5" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_5" title="View footnote.">5</a>]</sup>  is to refrain from violating the standards of
AsciiDoc in any way <sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_6" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_6" title="View footnote.">6</a>]</sup>.  This way
we should have a clean migration path via tools that would arise in the
case of a mass abandonment of AsciiDoc.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="pagure"><a class="anchor" href="#pagure"></a>Pagure</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Pagure is a standard git forge, as far as I know.  Therefore replacing
it with another git forge should not be a problem in the future.  As the
current migration away from <code>fedorahosted</code> shows, relying on Pagure for
issues should not cause us problems.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="asciibinder"><a class="anchor" href="#asciibinder"></a>AsciiBinder</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>AsciiBinder is a site builder that leverages the power of git and
Asciidoctor to produce a full site.  It is based on standardized ruby
templating and uses CSS and JavaScript to produce the final static site.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because AsciiBinder has been adopted by several major upstream projects
which are backed by Red Hat, I believe a wholesale abandonment of the
tooling is unlikely.  While we have relied on Red Hat maintained tooling
before and had challenges, <code>publican</code> was not widely adopted.  The level
of adoption leads me to believe that a path forward will always exist.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That said, because AsciiBinder is just a site builder, as long as we
maintain compatibility with AsciiDoc, we shouldn&#8217;t have a problem moving
to a new toolchain.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="po4a"><a class="anchor" href="#po4a"></a>po4a</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>.pot/.po</code> tool, <code>po4a</code>, has a long history as an open source project.
Its community has varied in size and activity over the 14+ years it has
been around, but it has never been abandoned.  Fedora also has a packager
maintaining it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is no commonly accepted and standardized way of translating AsciiDoc
with a tool like Zanata.  I believe this problem will only continue to
become more and more acute until it is solved.  While this creates risk
for the future and there is no path forward that seems obvious, it also
creates opportunity for Fedora to lead the way in solving a problem.</p>

<a href="#_footnoteref_2">2</a>. If you&#8217;re not familiar with <a href="https://github.com/projectmallard/pintail/">pintail</a>, it is a mallard site generator that can also do conversions from <a href="https://github.com/projectmallard/pintail-asciidoc">AsciiDoc</a> and DocBook to XML for processing.  It uses CSS and XSL to build sites. It is being considered for adoption by the Gnome Community.

</div>
<div class="footnote" id="_footnote_4">
<a href="#_footnoteref_4">4</a>. Pintail converts AsciiDoc, and I believe DocBook, to an intermediate XML form of Mallard before processing documentation into a site.  I feel very strongly that tools should do as little automated conversion as possible.  While most of the time nothing bad happens, when it does go sideways debugging is painful when multiple layers of conversions and intermediate formats are involved.
